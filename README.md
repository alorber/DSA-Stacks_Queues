# DSA2 Stacks & Queues

This is an implementation of stacks and queues for <i>Data Structures and Algorithms</i> project 1.

The aim of this project was to develop a program that would use data structures to implement a stack and queue. 
The program would ask the user for an input and output file and then process each instruction in the input file. 
The possible instructions are:

1) Create <i>(name) (stack/queue)</i>: A stack or queue with the specified name should be created. If it has already been created, the program should throw an error.
2) Push <i>(name) (value)</i>: The value should be pushed to the specified stack or queue. If it does not exist then the program will throw an error.
3) Pop <i>(name)</i>: Pops a value from the specified stack or queue. If it does not exist then the program will throw an error.
